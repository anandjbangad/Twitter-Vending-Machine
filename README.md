# Twitter-Vending-Machine
This was built for the publicity of a hackathon. Whenever the participants tweet on the hackathon page they get a code in their inbox which is run by a script.
This code is stored in a SQL database. The participant enters the code in the vending machine. If the user enters the right code then the a goody comes out of the vending machine.
